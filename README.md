# 4-Code-Quiz

## Description

This is a short quiz populated almost entirely with javascript code. The initial welcome screen is populated with JS elements and text. Once the button is clicked, the an event listener removes the elements and text and presents new elements and text, including 4 buttons. The questions and text are stored and pulled from an array of objects containing the question text, the options and the correct answer. Again with an event handler the user clicks a button and based on the text in the button it decides whetehr the answer is consiodered correct or incorrect. That correct/inc status is stored in the browser. A timer starts at the click of the begin button. It deducts time when a wrong answer is given. Once the tiemr runs out, new elements are created and appended to say "TIme's Up". If all questions are answered in the time allowed, the user is shown their score and given a chance to store their initials into the browser and presented in another screen.

I ran out of time developing this, so the app is incomplete as is. Based on my lengthy code I learned the importance of not repeating yourself. I still lean toward trying to get the app to work over cleanliness but the repition I see in my code is undoubtedly an issue I would like to remedy.
